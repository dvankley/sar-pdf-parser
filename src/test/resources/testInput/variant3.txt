                    Once  the schools  you  applied  to  have  processed your  FAFSA  form,  they will send  you  financial aid                          
                    offers.  These  aid  offers  tell  you what  aid you can  receive  at  a particular  college  or  career school.                     
                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                         
                    Keep  in mind  that you  don't have  to accept all the student  aid that is  offered,  and  that  your  schools                      
                    may  offer amounts   that differ from  your  federal  student  aid estimates.
